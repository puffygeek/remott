                    <p>Remott is a new brilliant way of living life to the fullest, while getting stuff done at the office. We organize “Remote Sprints”, so you and your team can focus on work while having a wonderful time in the beautiful Costa Rica.<br></p>

                  <div class="text">
                    <p>We had many different teams use Remott, for many different reasons. You might want a change of scenery so you can focus on an important task, or want to get the creative juices flowing, perhaps your team is remote and you want to get together for a week and work, or you feel like you never get around to actual team building since work hours are so packed already. Ultimately - most team leaders who use Remott just have a great team that they want to reward.<br></p>

                  <div class="text">
                    <p>Nope. Remott is more of a concierge service. Organising a “Remote Sprint” can be a really taxing task, and can take months of preparations and research - often with unexpected hitches that could have been avoided. With Remott, a few clicks and you can be sure that all the details are sorted out and taken care of, and you can enjoy the perfect plan for your team.&nbsp;<br></p>

                  <div class="text">
                    <p>Remott was created by developers, for developers. We understand how you work and what your needs are. We also understand team building, and how to strengthen your dynamics as a group of individuals working together. Finally we’re also big on having fun and experiencing the world and what it has to offer. When you “Remott” your team, we work with you to plan the perfect mixture of all those things in one amazing unforgettable week.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p>A week with Remott includes first and foremost work. We call it a “Remote Sprint” for a reason - there are goals and tasks that need to be completed. On top of that there are different activities and team building sessions that happen throughout the week. Also, in Remott we know how much personal free time is important, so don’t worry, there’s plenty of that too.</p>
